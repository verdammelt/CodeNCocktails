    The location was too crowded and too loud.  But the drinks and food were
    good.  Moss declared that his Temporary Fix was good and he would gladly
    push it to production.  Zach gamely ordered the Negroni never having one
    before and found that it was not something he liked.  mjs was quite
    pleased with both of his drinks.
